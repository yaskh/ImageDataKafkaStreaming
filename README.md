This application is designed to demonstrate the streaming of compressed image data using Apache Kafka. It consists of two main components: a producer that generates and sends compressed image data, and a consumer that receives, decompresses, and saves the data as images.

## Prerequisites

- Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper running locally or accessible remotely.
- Python 3.7+ with packages: `kafka-python`, `numpy`, `Pillow`, `zlib`, `base64`.

## Setup
